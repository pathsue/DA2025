Image Prompt 1: Abstract Conceptual Representation of Decision Analysis in AI "A visually striking conceptual image depicting an AI-driven decision analysis process using Python. A large glowing decision tree with interconnected nodes extends across the image, symbolizing structured decision-making. Python script elements float around the tree, seamlessly blending with statistical graphs and predictive models. Streams of data, in the form of bright neon circuits, flow through the tree, illustrating the integration of Python-powered algorithms. The background is dark with a subtle blue gradient, providing a modern, high-tech aesthetic. The composition is sleek and futuristic, representing the fusion of artificial intelligence, analytics, and Python-based decision modeling."

Image Prompt 2: Futuristic Tech-Themed Decision-Making Workspace "A high-tech futuristic workspace where a data scientist is analyzing decision trees on multiple holographic screens. The screens display Python code, statistical charts, and decision analysis models, glowing with neon blue and cyan hues. The person is using a sleek keyboard, with lines of Python code dynamically appearing on a transparent screen. A large AI assistant, represented as a glowing neural network, is assisting in the decision-making process. The background is a futuristic lab with dim lighting, emphasizing the holographic projections and cybernetic aesthetics. The setting exudes a sense of advanced AI-driven data analysis, perfect for illustrating decision analysis using Python."
